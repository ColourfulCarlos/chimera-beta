            <h2>Supporting Chimera</h2>
            <p>Chimera is a free website and resource to use, without any paywalls, premium features or hidden capacity.
                Everything that Chimera provides is for everyone.</p>
            <p>While this is my first project from scratch as a full-stack developer I want to continuously keep working
                on Chimera with the addition of new features, new ways to customize and new exciting ways to
                interconnect your Heroes on Chimera.</p>
            <p>The most direct way to support development of this project is with Patreon, where you as a contributor
                will ensure the community gets regular Chimera updates with new features and bug fixes. You'll also get
                access to my Patreon activity stream, where you can follow directly the development of Chimera updates.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Ads?</h2>
            <p>Ads are an indirect but important way to support Chimera. While many players might use Chimera in their
                daily playtime not many will be able to contribute via Patreon for the continuity of this project. So to
                assure that at the very least the website is running and updated I made the decision of running 3 small
                ads in between sections to ensure that objective.</p>
            <p>Please consider whitelisting this website from your adblocker, the ads are non-intrusive and such a small
                gesture will help me pay the bills related to Chimera.</p>

            <p class="text">Chimera is a community support website produced in a non-commercial environment, as such the
                current and future versions of Chimera will always be free and shareable throughout Marvel’s Avengers
                online community with the intent to be a common place to view, share and seek more information about the
                game.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Marvel's Avengers is built upon feedback from the community and likewise this project is
                open-sourced for anyone that wants to contribute and help the community. You can provide feedback
                directly on GitHub, or, you can always find me on Discord.</p>
            <p class="text">It's my intent for this to be one of the best third-party resources that the community can
                find, and I hope to achieve this with help of the community itself, so don’t forget to: use, share and
                support Chimera. </p>

            <h3 class="what">Team Behind Chimera</h3>
            <p class="text">Hello Avengers, my name is Carlos, a recent Web Developer with a huge love for comic-books.
                I started this project in the hopes of practicing my new found powers but while playing during the Beta
                Weekend I knew instantly that I would spend hundreds and hundreds of hours in this marvelous universe.
            </p>
            <p class="text">I’m an avid player of Destiny, Division, World of Warcraft and many others, and I always
                loved the websites and apps that the community would build for others, so why not build my own from the
                experience and inspired by those community resources?
            </p>
            <p class="text">As I said earlier, I am quite recent in the whole Web Development world and as such, changes
                and problem fixing will take some time, bare with me while I develop my skills in this project that I
                know will give everything that I’m capable of.

        <div class="todo">
            <h3 class="what">Future Features</h3>
            <p class="text">As of right now The Chimera is built upon a database created by me with the help of the
                community, as such the features presented today are quite static in terms of interaction with the
                player. That however could change with the release of a public API which would permit a direct
                interaction within a player's account and Chimera and as consequence open up many more features like:
